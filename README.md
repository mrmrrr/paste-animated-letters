**Your Text** — text that you want to place, for now it takes only one word at a time  
**Comp Prefix** — prefix of composition name, like "Letter_A" where "Letter_" is a prefix, leave it empty if there is none  
**Folder** — choose folder where compositions are stored in project panel  

  
  
Then click **OK**, comps with letters will be placed in your active comp.  
After that you will see a **Null** with **Slider Controller** which will adjust space between letters.  
The last step is **Break** button which will break connection between **Null** and letters for more precise adjusting letters.
