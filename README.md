**your text** — text that you want to place, for now it takes only one word at a time  
**folder name** — where compositions are stored in project panel  
**comp prefix** — name prefix of composition, like "Letter_A" where "Letter_" is a prefix, leave it empty if there is no prefix  
  
  
Then click OK, comps with letters will be pasted in your active comp.  
After that you have a **Null** with **Slider Controller** that will controll space between letters.  
The last step is **Break** button which will break connection between **Null** and letters.  
You can more precisely arrange the letters.
